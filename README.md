# Auction-Bidding

#### Auction Bidding project is a live streaming project that uses kafka to stream bidding data from Flask website.

### What are we implementing here?
#### Parallel processing of data that leads to less time consumption.

## About the Project:
#### The project is based on an auction where people bid for certain products. It is an end-to-end pipeline where a web application takes input from the end user and the submissions are stored in a database. A real time dashboard then shows the latest insights on that data.

#### This project uses kafka to publish records to the DB and consume from it to display on a dashboard.
